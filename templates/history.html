    Since the conferenceâ€™s inaugural year, the committee has grown to include students from different schools in the New York area, including Hunter College, Baruch College, Fordham University, the School of Visual Arts, and Brooklyn College. The theme for the second conference was REDEFINE, in which attendees explored the evolution of the Asian American community and were asked to redefine what it means to be Asian American.<br/><br/>

The fifth annual conference was themed EMERGING PROFILES which explored the ways in which the Internet and media have shaped
