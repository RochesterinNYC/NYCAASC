    <h2>Mission Statement</h2><br/>
    The New York City Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC) is an annual gathering dedicated to promoting awareness of Asian Pacific American issues and history among youth. Based in New York City and planned by college students, NYCAASC offers a broad range of engaging workshops and panels that address issues pertinent to Asian Pacific Americans on local, national, and global scales.<br/><br/>
This conference strives to support an accessible space to convene student leaders, community activists and professionals in the greater New York City metropolitan area to engage in meaningful dialogue, inspire informed discussions of social, political, economic, and historical issues relevant to Asian Pacific Americans, challenge attendees to share their diverse experiences with open minds, empower attendees to actively rethink notions of identity, community,
and social responsibility, and build, organize, and transform broader movements for social and political change.<br/></br><br/>
    <h2>Theme</h2></br>
    The theme for the 7th annual New York City Asian American Student Conference (NYCAASC) is En Route. In past conferences, we examined different notions of Asian American identity and how Asian Americans are reclaiming authorship of their stereotyped representations. This year, we seek to explore how Asian Americans are reinventing themselves by moving beyond their own communities and contributing to an inter- cultural dialogue.<br/><br/>
    Home of the annual NYCAASC, New York City pushes boundaries by connecting members from diverse backgrounds. We use the New York City subway system as a metaphor for the intricacies of the Asian American identity. As the subway system has multiple lines connecting many stations, Asian Americans are able to depart from any point and arrive at their chosen destinations. As they explore new perspectives, they may also aspire to pursue other destinations. We ask attendees to be
    conscious of how they traverse the various facets of their identities, and how they can actively build upon and bridge the communities beyond those they associate with. At a crossroads, Asian American identity serves as a source of inspiration, strength, and pride for themselves and others.<br/><br/>
